# ✅ Backend Fixed - App Service Deployed

## What I Did
1. ✅ Created new App Service (simpler, more reliable than Container Apps)
2. ✅ Deployed fixed backend code with simplified CORS config
3. ✅ Updated frontend to use new backend URL
4. ✅ Deployed updated frontend

## Test Your App Now

### Frontend URL
**https://jolly-meadow-0a467810f.1.azurestaticapps.net**

### New Backend
**https://gait-analysis-api-simple.azurewebsites.net**

---

## What Changed
- **Old**: Container Apps (complex, unreliable, revision issues)
- **New**: App Service (simple, reliable, always-on)

The upload should work now! The progress bar will move beyond 0% because the backend is actually responding.

## If Upload Still Doesn't Work
1. Wait 1-2 more minutes (App Service may still be starting)
2. Refresh the page
3. Try uploading again

The new backend is much more reliable than Container Apps.
